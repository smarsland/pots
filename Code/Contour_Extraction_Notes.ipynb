    "### Other Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Image Binarization__: It is often the case that the contour defining methods (such as active contour, marching squares etc) cannot find the exact outline of the pot in many of the pot images. This could be for a variety of reasons such as, other objects or shadows being in the image, or the pot itself has a very well-defined pattern within pot, which is more defined than its outline. For this reason, it may be beneficial to edit the image before extracting any contours. The function <code>binary_colour(img)</code> is designed to highlight the outline of the pot. It sets out two limits, say _p1_ and _p2_, then changes all pixels that have a colour lighter than _p1_ to white, and all those darker than _p2_ to black. It will then turn all pixels that are surrounded by black pixels black too. Thus we are left with an image that is roughly binarized into black and white pixels, with some greys floating around too (points between _p1_ and _p2_). This function works well in getting the contour algorithms to avoid the inside of the pot. On other hand, due to preset limits _p1_ and _p2_ it might not work well with all pots e.g. pots with really dark images with lots of shadows. Furthermore there is a separate function for binarizing images of pots that have been set against a pure white background e.g. Armand's photos of matamados pots. For these sorts of images, the funcion <code>binary_colour_matamados(img)</code> can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Algorithm Identification__: To decide which contour extraction algorithm to use for each pot, we must identify which group the pot falls into. There are multiple ways one can go about doing this for example, we can identify the group indiviudally by looking at the pots, we can use the given Beazley class and make the decision using the pot's class, or we can use an algorithm that automatically sorts the pot into a group. The third option is clearly the best way however the algorithm is still a work in process. Thus until that is ready, we will go with the second option. We load aa csv containing a list of all Beazley pot classes, and the group they are usually associated to. (Note that by _pot class_ we mean the class and its specific genus e.g. \"amphora neck\" not just \"amphora\".) For example, lekythos tend to never have more than one handle - thus we associate them with Group 1/2, whilst bell-kraters will be associated to Group 3. Naturally this method is not perfect as there are classes that have varying handle e.g. Hydrias sometimes come with bell-krater-like handles sticking out on each side, and sometimes they have one amphora-like-handle looping back onto the pot on one side of the pot. There are also times where an image has been edited to remove a handle thus it should be associated with Group 1/2, but the pot has been linked to the group of its pot class instead. In these cases, the algorithm looks for a handle to remove (even if it doesn't exist) and makes an estimate of where it is and thus makes a cut. To decide which algorithm to use, we use the function <code>choose_alg(potclass,table)</code>. The filename of the pot can be used as _pot class_ if the class is contained within the name. This function outputs the name of the algorithm best suited for the pot, based on the pot class. At present, pots in Group 5 will be associated with Group 4, which will then be sorted out in the contour extraction automation code. Furthermore, note that pot classes that are associated with Groups 1 and 2, will have a result of \"A1\" i.e. \"Algorithm 1\" from the function. We will then automatically sort this subgroup into A1 and A2 based on where we think the handle lies. At present, this method works well in identifying which side the handle lies for most pots, though for some pots that are notably thinner and don't have handles sticking far out of the pot e.g. lekythos, it is more difficult to identify which side the handle is on.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Additional Smoothing__: Each contour extraction algorithm includes a very basic smoothing of pot contours by rounding coordinates and accepting only one x coordinate for every y coordinate. This basic smoothing helps remove some noise and to remove horizontal spikes going within the pot from its contour (mostly due to the patterns within the pot). However, due to other factors such as the quality of the image, or the way in which an algorithm has cut off a handle, it is often the case that further smoothing is required. To resolve this we have a further 3 smoothing algorithms.\n",
    "    - <code>smooth_group_1_2_5(x,y,level)</code>: this function  is used for smoothing pot contours of pots from Groups 1,2 and 5. The parameters ___x___,___y___ are the coordinates of the contour obtained from the contour extraction algorithm and the parameter ___level___, depicts the level of smoothing wanted, _0_ indicated a basic smoothing whilst _1_ indicated a more advanced smoothing. A basic smoothing splits the contour into 3 parts, and smooths the _middle_ section using a cubic spline using Scipy's function <code> interpolate.splrep(x_mid, y_mid, smoothing_level)</code> whilst the other sections are left untouched. An advanced smoothing, splits the contour into 6 or 7 parts. It then smooths the sections using a cubic spline with varying levels of smoothness. Note that smoothing isn't applied to the lid/lip due to the poor results obtained from this. This is often due to the high curvature in the lid/lip area. The base of the pot often has a similar issue which is why it is not smoothed in the basic level of smoothing and only occasionally smoothed in the advanced level.\n",
    "    - <code>smooth_group_3(x,y,y1,y2,img,level)</code>: this function  is used for smoothing pot contours of pots from Group 3. The parameters ___x___,___y___ are the coordinates of the contour obtained from the contour extraction algorithm; the parameters ___y1___,___y2___ depict the coordinate of the start and end of the handle on the pot contour; ___img___ is the pot image (this can be the binarized image, the original image in colour, or a grey-scaled version of the original image); and lastly the parameter ___level___, depicts the level of smoothing wanted. A basic smoothing splits the contour into 4 parts, loosely based on where tha handle used to start and end. It then smooths the first middle section (where the handle started) using a linear spline with Scipy's function <code> interp1d(x_mid, y_mid, kind='slinear')</code> and smooths the middle section after the handle ends using a cubic spline. The other sections are then left untouched. An advanced smoothing, splits the contour into 6 or 7 parts. For the section between the start of the handle and end of the handle it uses SKimage's active contour function <code>snake = active_contour(gaussian(img, 1), init,bc = 'fixed',alpha=1.5, beta=2, w_line=20, w_edge=15, gamma=0.9,max_px_move=2,max_iterations=150)</code> where _beta_ is the smoothing parameter. It then uses a cubic spline with varying levels of smoothing for the other sections.\n",
    "    - <code>smooth_group_4(x,y,y1,y2,level)</code>: this function  is used for smoothing pot contours of pots from Group 4. The parameters ___x___,___y___ are the coordinates of the contour obtained from the contour extraction algorithm;the parameters ___y1___,___y2___ depict the coordinate of the start and end of the handle on the pot contour, and the parameter ___level___, depicts the level of smoothing wanted. A basic smoothing splits the contour into 6 parts. The section near the top of the handle is then smoothed using a cubic spline. The aim is for the contour to follow the neck of the pot where the handle has been cut (a problem often seen the contour extraction of amphorae). A linear spline is then added near the end of the handle and the remaining sections are smoothed using a cubic spline with varying levels of smoothness. An advanced smoothing, splits the contour into 7 or 8 parts. The top part near the start of the handle is again smoothed using a cubic spline. Next, the part of the contour near the end of handle is smoothed using a quadratic spline, whilst, once again, the remaining sections are smoothed with cubic splines. \n",
    "    \n",
    "It must be noted that additional smoothing doesn't always improve the pot contour (and may on rare occasions worsen the contour) which is why it has not been added as a compulsary part to the contour extraction algorithms."

    "## Automated Contour Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways we can extract a contour from a pot image using the above algorithms. We can extract a contour from a binarised image, or the original image (grey-scaled); we can apply additional smoothing to the contour at various levels of smoothing; we can even extract a contour using a different algorithm e.g. use extraction_3_cups for a bell-krater instead of extraction_3. Or we can obtain the contour from the opposite side e.g. by setting the parameter __*opposite_side*__ to be true. Other things we can do include automatic detection of bad pots (emthods for this usually only catch the really noisy contours and those that have spikes, thus usually misses those with sublte mistakes such as incorrect handle removal). Below is an <u>example</u> of how we can automate contour extraction. In the example, we binarize almost all pot images (we exclude really dark images since binarization will not help these); we decide on the algorithm by looking at the filename, and we compute additional basic-level smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It must be noted that this is just an example. There will undoubtedly be pots that will be assorted into an incorrect group (for example, due to the photo of the pot being taken at a different angle, excluding handles); there will be pots that have their contour harder to find by binarization (for example, this could be due the pot being sat on top of a dark table); there will be pot contours which would have been perfect if they were taken from the opposite side, and there will be pot contours that are decent but have been made to look bad because of the additional smoothing (with basic-level smoothing this may happen with Group 4 pots, but very unlikely for the other groups).
